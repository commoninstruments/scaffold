# Scaffold

This context describes the language for the Scaffold project: a docs-first baseline and reusable agent guidance for starting or standardizing Howells projects.

## Language

**Scaffold Baseline**:
The shared Howells starting point for project shape, tooling, package boundaries, agent workflow, deployment expectations, and launch readiness.
_Avoid_: Starter template, boilerplate

**Project Docs**:
The canonical documentation in `docs/` that defines the Scaffold Baseline for humans and agents.
_Avoid_: Skill references, generated docs

**Agent Skill**:
Reusable agent-facing guidance that helps a supported coding assistant apply the Scaffold Baseline to a new or existing project.
_Avoid_: Codex skill, prompt

**Agent Skill Distribution**:
The packaged form of the Project Docs for coding assistants such as Codex, Claude Code, and Cursor.
_Avoid_: Canonical skill source, prompt

**Skill Wrapper**:
A platform-specific packaging layer that exposes the Agent Skill Distribution to a supported coding assistant without changing the underlying Project Docs.
_Avoid_: Separate skill, fork
